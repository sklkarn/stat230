Sampling Method: The goal of sampling is to create a sample that is representative of the population it is being drawn from. The size of population is represented using the letter and the size of sample is represented using the letter The most basic sampling methods are:    Simple Random Sampling: Every member of the population, has an equal chance of being selected for the sample, .     Stratified Sampling: The population, is split into non-overlapping groups (strate), then simple random sampling is done on each group to form a sample, For example: split population of student in 'women' and 'men' group.     Systematic Sampling: Every individual from the population, is placed in the sample,      Convenience Sampling (Voluntary response sample): Easily obtained individuals from the population, are placed in the sample, .

  "body": " Variables  A variable is a property that can take on many values. In other words, it is characteristics of population which differs from individual to individual. For examples: \"length\", \"mass\", \"age\", \"gender\", \"place\", \"temperature\", \"proximity to a neighbour,\" etc.  Variable is taken as singular. \"age\" is a variable but \"ages\" is not a variable.  There are two types of variables:   Quantitative (numerical) variables:   Discrete variables: countable or finite number of values. For example: number of children in a household.    Continuous variables: measured or infinite number of values. For example: temperature, length of song, etc.       Qualitative (categorical) variables: Nominal, ordinal. For examples: \"eye colors: brown, black\", \"state: Kentucky, Florida\", \"dog breeds: Jerman shepheerd, Husky \", \"gender: male, female\", \"survey\" etc.      Independent and dependent variables: To test cause-and-effect relationships there are two kinds of variables based on whether to manipulate or measure. Imagine that researchers want to test the effectiveness of a new weight loss medication. They split participants into three groups: one group gets 0 mg dosage (control), another gets a 50 mg dosage, and the last group gets a 100 mg dosage. After six months, the participants weights are measured.  The independent variable is the cause. Its value is independent of other variables in your study. It can be manipulated. For example: doses.  The dependent variable is the effect. Its value depends on changes in the independent variable. It can be measured. For example: weight.  "

  "body": " Levels of Measurement  They are also called scales of measurement. It tells how precisely variables are recorded. In scientific research, a variable is anything that can take on different values across the data set (e.g., height or test scores).  There are 4 levels of measurement:    Nominal: the data can only be categorized. For example: color, gender, preferences, etc.     Ordinal: the data can be categorized and ranked. Here order of the data matters but distances between values does not. For example: I, II, and III place in race. Suppose, I took 10 seconds to finish the race, II took 15 seconds, and III took 25 second to finish the race.     Interval: the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced. Here order matters and distance between values are equal and meaningful, and a natural zero is not present (or zero is arbitrary, it has no meaning). Negative values are allowed. For example: Temperature in Celcius or Fahrenheit scale. As does not mean no temperature or no heat; IQ score, Time of the day, SAT scores, pH scale, calender years, etc.     Ratio: the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero. Negative values are not allowed. Here order matters and distance between values are equal and meaningful, and a natural zero is present. For example: Temperature in Kelvin scale. As means no temperature or no heat; height, Weight, age, speed of a vehicles, income levels, distance travelled, time duration, etc.   There is a hierarchy in the complexity and precision of the level of measurement, from low (nominal) to high (ratio). Nominal data has less information than ratio data.  Different types of data allow for the different types of data analysis.  "

  "title": "Measure of Central Tendency",
  "body": " Measure of Central Tendency   In statistics, understanding the data is very import to draw any information and conclusion. Central tendency and dispersion help us know the data distribution and their characteristics. Central tendency is the descriptive summary of a data set. It aims to provide an accurate description of the entire data in the distribution. The central tendency of the dataset can be found using the three important measures namely mean, median and mode .  An average of the data can be the best measurement of central tendency. There are two ways to determine an average of the data:   Mathematical:   Arithmatic Mean (Mean)    Geometric Mean    Harmonic Mean       Positional:   Median    Mode          Mean (average)    Here, is the observation of sample, and is number of observations.  In mean, numerical variables are affected by outliers or extreme values. For example: The mean of x Now suppose, then   Mean gives no information if there are any outliers in the data.  There are three types of mean being used in mathematical operations: Arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean. Here we only discuss the arithmetic mean . There are three methods to determine the arithmetic mean.   Direct Method    Assume Mean Method, and    Step Deviation Method     Here we are trying to build an idea to find mean of the three different data (series):   Individual Series    Discrete Series, and    Continuous Series.       Raw Data (individual series):  The value of mean can be calculated as Here, is the observation of sample, and is number of observations.  The mean (also known as the average) is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values. It provides a balanced representation of the entire dataset. To acknowledge that we are calculating the population mean and not the sample mean, we use the Greek lower case letter \"mu\", denoted as : An important property of the mean is that it includes every value in your data set as part of the calculation. In addition, the mean is the only measure of central tendency where the sum of the deviations of each value from the mean is always zero.  The mean of    The mean of ungrouped data     The mean of ungrouped data       Discrete Series:  The mean can be calculated using the following methods:    Direct method:       Assumed mean method:  here, is assumed mean (middle mean value), is frequency of observation, and the deviation of observation,         Direct method to calculate Mean of grouped data:  Here is the caculation: Now,     Assumed mean method to calculate Mean of grouped data  Here is the caculation: To find the assumed mean, A we select the central observation (in case of two items at the middle, we need to select those observation which has high frequency). For the table above we select  Now,      If observations are not in order then first need to arrange the observation either in asscending or descending order as shown below:   First arrange in asscending order. Take , as observation 10 has higher frequency than 12. Now,     Continuous Series:  In continuous series, the observations are presented in different class intervals rather than by a single number and the frequency. It can be presented in two different types of class intervals: Exclusive series and Inclusive series. Continuous series includes the upper limit and the lower limit in the class interval. If the upper limit interval does not repeat itself as a lower limit of the next class interval then it is an inclusive series. There is a gap between upper limit of any class interval to the and lower limit of the next class interval. e.g., If the upper limit interval repeats itself as a lower limit of the next class interval then it is an exclusive series. There is no gap between the upper limit of any class interval to the and lower limit of the next class interval. e.g.,   The mean ( weighted mean of grouped data ) can be calculated using the following methods:   Direct method:  take average of each class range and the value in column.      Step deviation method: This method is only applicable for continuous series. here, , class interval. take .        Combined Mean       The mean weight of 15 students is 110 kg. The mean of 5 of them is 100 kg and another 5 kg of them is 125 kg, then the mean weight of remaining students is   120    105    115    none.        here        Median   Median, in statistics, is the middle value of the given list of data when arranged in an order. It is also called the positional average. In median, numerical variables are less influenced by outliers. For even number of items in data, median is the average of two middle values of the ordered data. For odd number of items in data, median is just the middle item in the ordered data. For example:   after arranging it in increasing order Here, appeared at the middle term, so it is a median of the given data.  Also, after arranging it in increasing order Here, and appeared as the middle terms, so it's median is average of these numbers.     Raw Data (individual series)  The median of the following data can be found by rearranging them either in ascending or in descending order then select middle item.    after arranging it in increasing order Here, appeared at the middle term, so it is a median of the given data.     after arranging it in increasing order Here, and appeared as the middle terms, so it's median is average of these numbers.         Median for odd number of terms is given by here is number of terms in a series.    Median for even number of terms is given by here is number of terms in a series.       If median of is 10, then find the value of     Arrange the series in order, Now, take average of two middle terms from even number series.          Discrete Series (data)  Find the median of the following series   First arrange the observations in order  is cumulative frequency. Number of observation, = odd. Therefore, Hence, .          Median for even numbers observations Therefore,       Continuous Series    = Lower limit of median class, , upper CF, = frequency, class interval.     Exclusive class series:    Arrange the series in order , Hence, the median class.    from         Inclusive class series:    Convert the inclusive class series into exclusive series   median class selection = term. Hence, the median class. from         Mode   It is the most frequent value of the data. It is used for categoriacal variables. mode = 10 (unimodal)   it has two most freuent data points, hence, the mode is and (Bimodal).   Mode is not possible.    Individual Series      mode = 10 (unimodal)     it has two most freuent data points, hence, the mode is and (Bimodal)     No mode possible.     No modal possible.       Discrete Series   Most frequent observation is appeared times. Hence, .   Most frequent observation is and both appeared times. Hence, and     Continuous Series   Exclusive class series:   L = lower limit of modal class, frequency of modal class, frequency of pre-modal class, frequency of post-modal class, class interval.  Modal class is the highest frequency class data. In the given series, is the modal class.    Inclusive class series  convert the inclusive class into exclusive class. now modal class =   therefore,    Properties of mode    It is the most frequent value.    Series can have unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, or no modal.    It is the most unstable average.    It is not based on all observations.    It is not affected by extreme values.        Summary  Mean is useful in numerical variables without outliers.  Median is useful in numerical variables with outliers.  Mode is useful in categorical variables.    Relation between Mean, Median, and Mode:   Perfectly symmetric distribution  here calculated, .   Bell Curve    In perfectly symmetric distribution, mean, median, and mode are coinsident on one another. That is,    Positively skewed distribution  here calculated, , and Hence, in perfectly symmetric distribution,    Positively skewed Curve    In positively skewed distribution, In skewed distribution, median always comes between mean and mode and follow the following relation.    Negatively skewed distribution  here calculated, , and .   Negatively skewed Curve    In negatively skewed distribution, In skewed distribution, median always comes between mean and mode and follow the following relation.    "

  "title": "Dispersion (Spread, Variability)",
  "body": " Dispersion (Spread, Variability)   It is a measure of the extent to which the observations vary from some central value (mean, median, mode). It shows how the data are spread out (dispersed) from the central value. In simple terms, it shows how squeezed or scattered the variable is. It is a measure of degree of variation in the data. The following images show two data with same mean but different spread.   Data Spread    For example: the mean of is Here, the dispersion shows how far are the observations from the mean (central value). The difference in each data point from the central value is represents deviation of the data.  Suppose I have the three data set as shown below: The data shows the difference in and . the observations in series A does not vary at all from the central value (mean), there is some variation in series B, b ut no observations are even close to the mean in series C.    Measurement of Dispersion  Dispersion can be measured using two different approaches.     Absolute Measure (same unit)  Absolute measures of dispersion use the original units of data, and are most useful on understanding the dispersion within the context of your experiment and measurements.   Range    Quartile Deviation    Mean Deviation    Standard Deviation    Variance       Relative Measure (unit free)  In order to compare separate data sets or different experiments that might use different units and the difference in their central values are very high, we use relative measures.   Coefficient of Range    Coefficient of Quartile Deviation    Coefficient of Mean Deviation    Coefficient of Standard Deviation    Coefficient of Variance       Note: Low dispersion means more stable observations.    Range   Range is the difference between the highest and the lowest value of observations for a given frequency distribution. The coefficient of range on the other hand is the ratio of difference between the highest and lowest value of observations to the sum of highest and lowest value of observations.      Here, largest observation, and smallest observation.  Range is sensitive to extreme value but cannot give any information if there are extreme values in the data. It does not consider the distribution but suitable for small dataset. For the data Range =   For the data Range =     Individual Series                              Discrete Series                              Continuous Series     Exclusive Series         Inclusive Series     First convert the inclusive series into exclusive one.          Merits of Range:     Among all the methods of studing dispersion range is the simplest to understand and easiest to compare.    Range is quickest measure of dispersion.       Limits of Range:     Range is not based on each and every observation of series.    It is most affected by sampling fluctuations.    Range is most unreliable as a guide of the dispersion.    Range cannot be calculated for the open-end classification.

Quartile deviation is a statistic that measures the deviation in the middle of the data. Quartile deviation is also referred to as the semi interquartile range and is half of the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile value. Quartiles divide a group of observations into four equal parts. The first quartile, denoted by is defined as the percentile, the second quartile ( ) is defined as the percentile (median), and the third quartile ( ) is defined as the percentile.  The formula for quartile deviation of the data is   The coefficient of quartile deviation is a measure of dispersion, which is used to describe the spread or distribution of data.  Coefficient of quartile deviation, Here, is first quartile (or, lower quartile),  is second quartile (or, median), and is third quartile (or, upper quartile) Where represents the total number of observations in the given data set.  For the data ,    Percentiles: It divide the data into 100 parts.      Inter Quartile Range (IQR):  It is less sensitive to extreme values.

  "title": "Graphical Representation",
  "body": " Graphical Representation   Graphical representation involves visual tools to summarize and present data in a way that highlights patterns, trends, and insights. There are different types of graphical representation. Some of them are as follows:      Line Graphs Line graph or the linear graph is used to display the continuous data and it is useful for predicting future events over time. Example: Stock prices over a year.   Line Graph       Bar Graphs Bar Graph is used to display the category of data and it compares the data using solid bars to represent the quantities. It compares the number, frequency, or other measure (e.g., mean) for different discrete categories. Example: Showing the sales of different product categories.   Bar graph       Histograms The graph that uses bars to represent the frequency of numerical data that are organised into intervals. Since all the intervals are equal and continuous, all the bars have the same width (called bins). Example: Distribution of students' test scores.   Histogram       Stem and Leaf Plot In the stem and leaf plot, the data are organised from least value to the greatest value. The digits of the least place values from the leaves and the next place value digit forms the stems. Example: Showing test scores in a detailed manner.      Box and Whisker Plot It displays the distribution of a dataset based on a five-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum). It shows the range (spread) and the middle ( median) of the data. Example: Comparing the distribution of test scores across different classes.   Box Plot    In a box plot, the upper whisker represents the upper boundary of the data that is not considered an outlier. It is calculated based on the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Here's how to calculate the upper whisker:  Upper Whisker (UW) equals to maximum data observation value that is less than or equal to Upper Bound. Lower Whisker (LW) equals to minimum data observation value that is greater than or equal to Lower Bound. Values greater than Upper Bound or less than Lower Bound are considered to be outliers.     Pie Chart (Circle Graph) It shows the relationships of the parts of the whole. The circle is considered with 100% and the categories occupied is represented with that specific percentage like 15%, 56%, etc. Example: Market share of different companies.   Pie Chart       Scatter Plot To show the relationship between two continuous variables. Example: Relationship between height and weight.   Scatter Plot       Frequency Table The table shows the number of pieces of data that falls within the given interval.        Outliers  Outliers are extreme data points with respect to normal data points. They are unusual values in your dataset which can distort statistical analyses and violate their assumptions. Unfortunately, all analysts will confront outliers and be forced to make decisions about what to do with them. Given the problems they can cause, you might think that it's best to remove them from your data. But, that's not always the case. Removing outliers is legitimate only for specific reasons.  Removing outliers: Outliers can be very informative about the subject-area and data collection process. It's essential to understand how outliers occur and whether they might happen again as a normal part of the process or study area. Unfortunately, resisting the temptation to remove outliers inappropriately can be difficult. Outliers increase the variability in your data, which decreases statistical power. Consequently, excluding outliers can cause your results to become statistically significant. There are two methods to remove outliers: standard deviation (z-score) method and IQR method. We can use the IQR method of identifying outliers to set up a “fence” outside of and . Any values that fall outside of this fence are considered outliers. To build this fence we take 1.5 times the IQR and then subtract this value from and add this value to . This gives us the minimum and maximum fence posts that we compare each observation to. Any observations that are more than 1.5 (IQR) below or more than 1.5 (IQR) above are considered outliers.   z-score    When a distribution is normal, the histogram takes on a bell shape, which is why it is sometimes referred to as a “bell curve.” A standard normal distribution, also called the z-distribution, is the most commonly used normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. In the standard normal distribution, of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean, falls within 2 standard deviations, and falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Consider the image of the bell curve. In all normal distributions, the area under the curve is 1, the curve is symmetrical around the mean, and exactly half of the data falls on the right and left of the mean. Any value falls out side of 3 standard deviation, that is less than and higher than are considered as outliers.    The student test scores are: 74, 88, 78, 90, 94, 90, 84, 90, 98, and 80. Find the outliers.    Arrange the data in ascending order: 74, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 90, 90, 94, 98.  Five number summary: 74, 80, 89, 90, 98.  Any scores that are less than 65 or greater than 105 are outliers. Hence, here we do not have any outliers.      A survey was given to a random sample of 20 sophomore college students. They were asked, “how many textbooks do you own?” Their responses, were: 0, 0, 2, 5, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 14, 15, 20, and 25.

It holds true if the sample size, 30 (population may be normally or skewed distributed). When then it only works for the normally distributed population.  The essential component of the CLT is that average sample means will be the population mean. Relation between the shape of population distribution and the shape of sampling distribution of mean is known as CLT. It helps inference about the population parameters without knowing the shape of frquency of population distribution. As the sample size gets larger, sampling distribution becomes almost normal regardless of the shape of population.   clt    According to CLT normal distribution is the limiting distribution to the sum of independent random variables with finite variance as the number of random variables get indefinitely large.  Since many real processes yield distributions with finite variance, this theorem has a wide range of application in sampling theory and other areas of statistics.

  "title": "Crosstabulation",
  "body": " Crosstabulation  Crosstabulation (cross-tab) is a table summary for two categorical vaiables It is used to understand patterns between the variables. It is also useful in hypothesis testing such as chi-square test and annova test. To know the relationship between two nominal variables like class and unemployment, gender and drug use we use hypothesis testing. Categorical data are separated into different categories that are mutually exclusive (independent) from one another. For example: eye color (blue, brown, green). It is impossible for eye color to belong to more than one color.  Cross-tab is used for nominal\/ordinal variables. It is a tool to descriptively examine variables and identify the relationship between two variables. The size of the crosstab is the number of categories of one variable multiplied by the number of categories of the second variable. Cross tab presents joint frequencies, hence it is alos clalled a ' joint contingency table '. Each cell is an intersection of the two categories at that point. Table below shows a sample layout of a crosstab. Analyzing large datasets can be difficult. Finding relevant, actionable insights within large amounts of data is even more complicated. Crosstabs simplify and divide data into subgroups for ease of interpretation—they show percentages and frequencies that may change when contrasted with variables in other categories. By making datasets more manageable at scale, fewer errors will result.   Cross tabulation is typically used when you have information that can be divided into mutually exclusive groups, also known as categorical variables. It allows you to examine relationships within the data that may not be readily apparent. A crosstab report can show the connection between two or more survey questions from the study in market research studies. A Chi-square test is used to test data in a cross-tabulation table to determine whether or not the data is statistically significant. The results are statistically significant if the two categorical variables are independent (unrelated). Basically, the Chi-square test is a correlation test for categorical variables.  cross tab may have additional information such as row and column marginals (i.e., total). The cell of the last row and the last column is called grand total. Here 68 is the grand total. Table can also reflect percentages. To find the percentage divide each cell value by the grand total and multiply them by 100. For example:   "

Probability can range from 0 to 1, where 0 means the event to be an impossible one and 1 indicates a certain event. The probability of all the events in a sample space adds up to 1.  For example, a fair coin is tossed, we can get either a Head OR a Tail. So, only two possible outcomes are possible . But when two coins are tossed then there will be four possible outcomes, i.e .  In this chapter we are going to discuss probability in the following steps.   General terminology, definition, Probability using permutation and combination;    Probability using set theory, addition and multiplication theorem;    Independent events, conditional probability, total probability theorem, Baye's theorem;    Probability distribution, random variable, binomial probability distribution, geometrical probability.      General Terminology     Random Experiment: An experiment whose outcome is known. e.g., tossing a coin, throwing a dice, drawing a card, etc.     Sample Space: Set of all possible outcomes. e.g., sample space of throwing a dice, . Here, 1, 2, 3,... etc. are sample points (or, sample outcomes); sample space of tossing a coin, .     Event: Subset of sample space. Getting an odd number in a dice. e.g.       Null Event: It has no outcome, or no element in it. For example suppose a sample space Now, an event, A = number greater than 6.  It is also called impossible or void event.     Simple Event: It is also called singleton event. It contains only one element or one outcome.  an event, B = Even prime number.       Mixed or Compound Events: Events that have more than one outcome but less than all.  C = prime numbers.      Sure Event: It is equal to sample space. e.g.,  D = all number less than 7.       Equally likely events: Having equal chances of occurrence.     Mutually exclusive or disjoint or incompatible events: Events whose simultaneous occurrence is impossible.

  "body": " Rules of Probability      Additional Rule: It is used to calculate the probability that either (or both) of two events will happen. Notation:     For mutually exclusive (disjoint) events (A) and (B) [events that cannot happen at the same time], the probability of (A) or (B) occuring is For example: toss of coin.    For non-mutually exclusive events (A) and (B) [events that can happen at the same time], the probability of (A) or (B) occuring is For example: draw a king of heart.       Multiplication Rule: It allows us to calculate the joint probability of multiple events occurring together using known probabilities of those events individually.   For Independent events (A) and (B) [events where occurance of one does not affect the other], the probability of (A) and (B) occuring is For example: tossing a coin twice. Tossing a coin first time does not affect what it comes in second time.    For dependent events (A) and (B) [events where occurance of one does affect the other], the probability of (A) and (B) occuring is Where is a conditional probability of (B) given (A). For example: Drawing I card affect the drawing of the II card without replacement.          What's the probability of drawing either a heart or a spade card from deck of cards?    In this case, you cannot get a card that is both a heart and a spade. There are 13 hearts, 13 spade cards. From , we have       What is the probability of drawing a card from a deck and getting either a diamond or a spade?    In this case, you cannot get a card that is both a diamond and a spade. There are 13 diamonds and 13 spade cards. From , we have       What is the probability of drawing a card from a deck and getting either an Ace or a King?    In this case, you cannot get a card that is both an Ace and a king. There are 4 Ace and 4 king cards. From , we have       What's the probability of drawing either a queen or a black card from deck of cards?    In this case, you can get a card that is both a queen and a black, so we need to subtract that probability to avoid double counting. There are 4 queens, 26 black cards, and two queen of black cards. From , we have       What's the probability of drawing either a queen or a heart from deck of cards?    In this case, you can get a card that is both a queen and a heart (the queen of hearts!) so we need to subtract that probability to avoid double counting. There are 4 queens, 13 hearts, and one queen of hearts. From , we have       What is the probability of flipping a fair coin and getting \"heads\" twice in a row?    In this case, flipping a coin first time would not affect the flipping the same coin on second time, so it is an independent event. Hence, from , we have       What is the probability of flipping a fair coin and getting \"head\" at first flip and \"tail\" at the second flip?    In this case, flipping a coin first time would not affect the flipping the same coin on second time, so it is an independent event. Hence, from , we have       From two packs of playing cards, what is the probability of drawing an \"ACE\" from the first pack and drawing a \"king\" from the second pack?    From , we have       From a single pack of playing cards, what is the probability of drawing an \"ACE\" at first draw and a \"king\" from the second draw without replacement?    This a dependent event where first action does affect the second action. Hence from , we have       In rolling two fair dices, what is the probability of getting 3 on both the dices?.    From , we have       From a pack of playing cards, what is the probability that both cards selected are black without replacement?    From , we have       Conditional probability:   It is the possibility of an event that based on the existence of a previous event or outcome. In other words, The probability of occurrence of any event A when another event B in relation to A has already occurred is known as conditional probability. It is depicted by , here \"|\" read as given . So reads as probability of A given B.  Imagine a student is absent from school twice a week, excluding Sunday. If it is known that he will be absent from school on Tuesday, then what are the chances that he will also be absent on Friday in the same week? It is observed that in problems where the occurrence of one event affects the happening of the following event, these cases of probability are known as conditional probability.   here is the number of elements common to both A and B. is the number of elements in B, and it cannot be equal to zero.   Bayes Theorem: Bayes' theorem defines the probability of occurrence of an event associated with any condition. This is known as the formula for the likelihood of “causes”.    "

  "title": "Hypothesis Testing",
  "body": " Hypothesis Testing   Hypothesis testing is a statistical method to draw conclusions (or make inferences) about a population based on sample data. It involves making an assumption (the hypothesis) and then using statistical techniques to determine the likelihood that this assumption is true. There are two categories of hypothesis testing: parametric and non-parametric. Parametric test gives generalization of generating records regarding the mean of the population. It is based on the assumption that the population data are normally distributed. Z-test, t-test, Annova tests are usually used in parametric test. Non-parametric test does not require any population distributin and are used when parametric test assumptions cannot be satisfied. test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, etc.  Use Parametric Tests When: The sample size is large enough (often ) to rely on the Central Limit Theorem, which implies that the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed. The data is normally distributed, or you have sufficient evidence to assume normality.  Use Non-Parametric Tests When: The data does not meet the assumptions required for parametric tests, such as normality. The sample size is small, making it difficult to assess or rely on the assumption of normality. You are dealing with ordinal data or ranked data instead of interval or ratio data. The data includes outliers or is skewed, which could affect the results of parametric tests.  Here's a basic outline of the hypothesis test process:    Formulate Hypotheses: Null Hypothesis : This is a statement of no effect or no difference. It represents the status quo or a baseline assumption. It assumes that there is no significant difference between the sample and population mean. Alternative Hypothesis : This is a statement that indicates the presence of an effect or a difference. It represents what you are trying to prove.     Choose the Significance Level  : The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common values for are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.     Select the Appropriate Test: The choice of test depends on the type of data and the hypothesis. Common tests include t-tests, chi-square ( ) tests, ANOVA test, F-test, and regression analysis.     Calculate the Test Statistic: This involves computing a value (test statistic) from the sample data that is used to evaluate the hypotheses.     Determine the P-value: The p-value is the probability of observing the test statistic or something more extreme if the null hypothesis is true. It helps in deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis.     Compare the P-value with the Significance Level: If the p-value is less than or equal to , reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than , fail to reject the null hypothesis.     Draw a Conclusion: Based on the comparison, conclude whether there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.       Test Selection   The choice between using a chi-square test, ANOVA, or F-test or others depends on the type of data you have and the hypotheses you are testing. Here's a brief overview to help you decide which test to use:   Z or T test: If population standard deviation is not known and the sample size is relatively small (typically ), then t-test is used instead of the Z-test. The t-test is more appropriate in these situations because it accounts for the additional variability introduced by estimating the population standard deviation from the sample.   z-test vs. t-test    z-test: and t-test:    Chi-square test: The chi-square test is used for categorical data to test relationships between variables or the goodness of fit of observed data to an expected distribution.   Chi-Square Test for Independence: Used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. Example: Testing if there is a relationship between gender (male, female) and voting preference (yes, no).    Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test: Used to determine if a sample data matches a population with a specific distribution. Example: Testing if the distribution of colors of M & Ms in a bag matches the company's stated proportions.      ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): ANOVA is used for comparing the means of three or more groups to see if at least one group mean is significantly different from the others.   One-Way ANOVA: Used when comparing the means of three or more independent groups based on one factor. Example: Testing if the average exam scores differ among students taught by three different teaching methods.    Two-Way ANOVA: Used when comparing means based on two factors and their interaction. Example: Testing if exam scores are affected by both teaching method and type of school (public, private).      F-Test: The F-test is used to compare variances or test hypotheses that involve variances.   F-test for Variances: Used to compare the variances of two populations to see if they are significantly different. Example: Testing if the variance in test scores between two classes is different.    F-statistic in ANOVA: The F-statistic is used within the ANOVA framework to determine if there are significant differences between group means. Example: As part of one-way or two-way ANOVA to compare group means.       One sample and two sample test.     When to use which test?      On analysis of one variable test (or one sample test): Continuous variables are counted or measured.  Categorical variables cannot be counted.   For one sample continuous variable, we use one sample t -test or z-test.  For one sample categorical variable, we use one sample proportion test.    For two sample continuous to continuous variables, we find correlation.    For one sample categorical and one continuous variable:  if there are only two classes in categorical variables, we use two-sample t-test or z-test.  if there are more than two classes in categorical variable, we use Annova test.    For two categorical variables, we use chi-square test.    For one categorical and one continuous variables but the target is categorical variable, then we go to logistic regression.       One-tail and two-tail Test  Technique to identify one-tailed and two-tailed test:   If the statement of questions uses the comparative degree: less than, more than, smaller than, larger than, taller than, superior, inferior, increase, decrease, at least, at most, only improved, then use one-tailed test .    Otherwise, use two -tailed test .     Note: If use Left-Tailed test, if then use right-tailed test, and if then use two-tailed test.    "

The above distribution shows the rejection regions and fail to rejection region (acceptance region) of Null hypothesis test in z test with the 95% confidence inetrval (or 5% significance level) in two tailed test.   Types of Z-tests:    One-Sample z-test: Tests whether the mean of a single sample is different from a known population mean.

  "title": "T Test",
  "body": " T Test   A t-test is used to compare the means of two groups and determine if the differences between them are statistically significant. It's commonly used when dealing with small sample sizes and when the population standard deviation is unknown. There are different types of t-tests, including:    One-sample t-test: Compares the mean of a single group against a known mean (or a hypothesized mean).     Independent two-sample t-test: Compares the means of two independent groups to see if they are significantly different from each other.     Paired sample t-test: Compares means from the same group at different times (e.g., before and after a treatment) or from matched pairs.       Steps to Perform a t-test      Formulate the Hypotheses:    Null Hypothesis (H0): Assumes no difference between the groups.    Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Assumes a significant difference between the groups.       Choose the Significance Level : Commonly used values are 0.05 or 0.01, representing a 5% or 1% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.    Calculate the Test Statistic:   For a one-sample t-test:     For an independent two-sample t-test:     For a paired sample t-test: Here, is the sample mean, is the population mean, is the sample standard deviation, is the sample size, is the mean difference in paired samples, and ​ is the standard deviation of the differences.       Determine the Degrees of Freedom (df):   For a one-sample t-test:     For an independent two-sample t-test:     For a paired sample t-test:        Find the Critical t-value: Using t-distribution tables or software, find the critical value for the given degrees of freedom and significance level.    Compare the Test Statistic to the Critical Value:   If the calculated t-value is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis.    Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.           One sample t -test: In the population, the average IQ is 100. A team of researcher want to test a new medication to see if it has either a positive or negative effect on intelligence or no effect at all. A sample of 30 participants who have taken the medication has a mean of 140 with a standard deviation of 20. Did the medication effect intelligence? [CI=95%]    Given:   Null hypothesis,   Alternative hypothesis, [two-tail test]  Significance value,   Degree of freedon,       Decision boundary: Use t table to find . If t-test or is less than -2.045 or greater than +2.045, reject null hupothesis.  Calculate t-test statistics,   Conclusion: Decision rule: If or t-test is less than -2.045 or greater than +2.045, reject null hupothesis. Here, We must reject null hypothesis. i.e., medication has positive effect on intelligence.      A random sample of size 20 from a normal population gives a sample mean of 42 and sample standard deviation of 6. Test the hypothesis that the population mean is 44.    Given:   Step I: Null hypothesis, (population mean is same as sample mean.)  Step II: Alternative hypothesis, (two tail test) (no wording for comparision)  Step III: Test Statistics:    Step IV: Level of significance,  use t table to determine the value of   Step V: Comparision and Decision: Hence, it is not significant, therefore, we fail to reject null hypothesis.
