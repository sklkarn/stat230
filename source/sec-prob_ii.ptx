        In this case, you cannot get a card that is both a heart and a spade. 
        There are 13 hearts, 13 spade cards.

        In this case, you cannot get a card that is both a diamond and a spade.

        In this case, you cannot get a card that is both an Ace and a king. 
        There are 4 Ace and 4 king cards.

    <solution>
      <p>
        In this case, you can get a card that is both a queen and a black,

      <p>
        In this case, you can get a card that is both a queen and a heart (the queen of hearts!) 
        so we need to subtract that probability to avoid double counting. There are 4 queens, 13 hearts, and one queen of hearts.
        From <xref ref="prob_eqn2"/>, we have

  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      In this case, flipping a coin first time would not affect the flipping the same coin on second time, so it is an independent event.
      Hence, from <xref ref="prob_eqn3"/>, we have 
      <me>
        P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}.

  <solution>
    <p>
      In this case, flipping a coin first time would not affect the flipping the same coin on second time, so it is an independent event.

  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
     This a dependent event where first action does affect the second action. Hence from <xref ref="prob_eqn4"/>, we have

    <term></term> It is the possibility of an event that 
    based on the existence of a previous event or outcome. In other words, 
    The probability of occurrence of any event A when another event B in relation to A has already occurred 
    is known as conditional probability. It is depicted by <m>P(A|B)</m>, here "|" read as <term>given</term>. 
   So <m>P(A|B)</m> reads as probability of A given B.

        Imagine a student is absent from school twice a week, excluding Sunday. 
        If it is known that he will be absent from school on Tuesday, 
        then what are the chances that he will also be absent on Friday in the same week? 
        It is observed that in problems where the occurrence of one event affects the 
        happening of the following event, these cases of probability are known as conditional probability.

         and 1 black balls, and Box C contains 3 white, 1 red, and 2 black balls. A box is chosen randomly 
         and from it two balls are taken at random. These two balls are one red and one white. 
         Find the probability that these balls are taken from Box A.
