          <term>Additional Rule:</term> It is used to calculate the probability that either (or both) of two events will happen. 
         <em> Notation:</em> <m>P(A \cup B), P(A + B), P(A \text{ or } B), P( \text{ either} A \text { or} B), P(\text{ at least } 1).</m>

                For <term>mutually exclusive</term> (disjoint) events (A) and (B) [events that cannot happen at the same time], 
                the probability of (A) or (B) occuring is 
                <men xml:id="prob_eqn1"> P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B).</men>
               For example: tossing a <em>coin once</em> .

                The probability of getting a Head or a Tail on tossing a coin.

                For example: drawing a <em>king of heart</em> from a deck of card.

              <p>
                The probability of getting a King of Heart on drawing a card from a deck of cards. 
                <me>
                  P(K \cup H) = P(K) + P(H) -P(K\cap H) = \frac{4}{52}+\frac{13}{52}-\frac{1}{52} = \frac{16}{52}.

          <term>Multiplication Rule:</term> It allows us to calculate the joint probability of multiple events 
          occurring together using known probabilities of those events individually.

                For example: tossing a <em>coin twice</em>. Tossing a coin first time does not affect what it comes in the second time.
                In independent events, total number of outcomes do not reduce.

                The probability of getting a 1 and then a 3 on rolling a fair dice.

                  P(1 \cap 3) = P(1) \times P(3) = \frac{1}{6}\times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}.

                For <term>dependent events</term> (A) and (B) [events where occurance of one does affect the other],

                Where <m>P(B|A)</m> is a conditional probability of (B) given (A). 
                For example: Drawing I card affect the drawing of the II card without replacement.

                The probability of getting a King and then a Queen on drawing cards from a deck without replacement. 
                <me>
                  P(K \cap Q) = P(K) \times P(Q/A) = \frac{1}{52}\times \frac{1}{51} = \frac{1}{2652}.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What's the probability of drawing either a heart or a spade card from deck of cards?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        In this case, you cannot get a card that is both a heart and a spade. 
        There are 13 hearts, 13 spade cards.
        From <xref ref="prob_eqn1"/>, we have 
        <me>
          P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = \frac{13}{52}+\frac{13}{52} = \frac{26}{52}.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is the probability of drawing a card from a deck and getting either a diamond or a spade?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        In this case, you cannot get a card that is both a diamond and a spade. 
        There are 13 diamonds and 13 spade cards.
        From <xref ref="prob_eqn1"/>, we have 
        <me>
          P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = \frac{13}{52}+\frac{13}{52} = \frac{26}{52}.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is the probability of drawing a card from a deck and getting either an Ace or a King?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        In this case, you cannot get a card that is both an Ace and a king. 
        There are 4 Ace and 4 king cards.
        From <xref ref="prob_eqn1"/>, we have 
        <me>
          P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = \frac{4}{52}+\frac{4}{52} = \frac{8}{52}.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What's the probability of drawing either a queen or a black card from deck of cards?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        In this case, you can get a card that is both a queen and a black, 
        so we need to subtract that probability to avoid double counting. There are 4 queens, 26 black cards, and two queen of black cards.
        From <xref ref="prob_eqn2"/>, we have 
        <me>
          P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)-P(A\cap B) = \frac{4}{52}+\frac{26}{52}-\frac{2}{52} = \frac{28}{52}.

        What's the probability of drawing either a queen or a heart from deck of cards?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        In this case, you can get a card that is both a queen and a heart (the queen of hearts!) 
        so we need to subtract that probability to avoid double counting. There are 4 queens, 13 hearts, and one queen of hearts.
        From <xref ref="prob_eqn2"/>, we have 
        <me>
          P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)-P(A\cap B) = \frac{4}{52}+\frac{13}{52}-\frac{1}{52} = \frac{16}{52}.

    <p>
      What is the probability of flipping a fair coin and getting "heads" twice in a row? 
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      In this case, flipping a coin first time would not affect the flipping the same coin on second time, so it is an independent event.
      Hence, from <xref ref="prob_eqn3"/>, we have 
      <me>
        P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}.

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      What is the probability of flipping a fair coin and getting "head" at first flip and "tail" at the second flip? 
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      In this case, flipping a coin first time would not affect the flipping the same coin on second time, so it is an independent event.
      Hence, from <xref ref="prob_eqn3"/>, we have 
      <me>
        P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}.

      From two packs of playing cards, what is the probability of drawing an "ACE" from the first pack and drawing a "king" from the second pack? 
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      From <xref ref="prob_eqn3"/>, we have

<example>
  <statement>

      From a single pack of playing cards, what is the probability of drawing an "ACE" at first draw and a "king" from the second draw without replacement? 
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
     This a dependent event where first action does affect the second action. Hence from <xref ref="prob_eqn4"/>, we have 
      <me>
        P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A) = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{4}{51}=\frac{4}{663}.

        P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36}.

  <title>Conditional probability: </title>
  <p>
    <term></term> It is the possibility of an event that 
    based on the existence of a previous event or outcome. In other words, 
    The probability of occurrence of any event A when another event B in relation to A has already occurred 
    is known as conditional probability. It is depicted by <m>P(A|B)</m>, here "|" read as <term>given</term>. 
   So <m>P(A|B)</m> reads as probability of A given B. 
  </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a student is absent from school twice a week, excluding Sunday. 
        If it is known that he will be absent from school on Tuesday, 
        then what are the chances that he will also be absent on Friday in the same week? 
        It is observed that in problems where the occurrence of one event affects the 
        happening of the following event, these cases of probability are known as conditional probability.
