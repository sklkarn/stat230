  <title>Events and Sample Space</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Probability is a measure of how likely the events are going to happen. 
      Probability can range from 0 to 1, where 0 means the event to be an impossible one and 1 indicates a certain event. 
      The probability of all the events in a sample space adds up to 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a fair coin is tossed, we can get either a Head OR a Tail. So, only two possible outcomes 
        are possible <m>(H, T)</m>. But when two coins are tossed then there will be four possible outcomes, 
        i.e <m>\{(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)\}</m>.

        If a random experiment has total of <m>(m+n)</m> mutually exclusive, mutually exhaustive, and equally likely outcomes, out of which 
        there are <m>m</m> favorable events <m>E</m>, then the probability of occurrence of event <m>E</m> is denoted by <m>P(E).</m>

    In sample space, <me>
      S = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n \}
    </me>
    each sample points are equally likely events, then we can find the probability of occurrence using <xref ref="eqn-prob1"/>. 
    However, if they are not equally likely then <xref ref="eqn-prob1"/> can not be used directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Note: </term> If all outcomes of sample space are not equally likely, then 
    <me>
      P(E) = \text { sum of probability of all the favorable outcomes of E.}

    here, in sample space,

      S = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n \}
     </me>
     <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots </m> are not equally likely outcomes, 
     then <xref ref="eqn-prob1"/> cannot be applied.
