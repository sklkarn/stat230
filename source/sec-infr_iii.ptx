  <title>T Test</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    A t-test is used to compare the means of two groups and determine if the differences between them 
    are statistically significant. It's commonly used when dealing with small sample sizes and when 
    the population standard deviation is unknown. There are different types of t-tests, including:
<ol marker ="i">
  <li>
    <p>
     <alert> One-sample t-test:</alert> Compares the mean of a single group against a known mean (or a hypothesized mean).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <alert>Independent two-sample t-test:</alert> Compares the means of two independent groups to see if they are 
      significantly different from each other.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <alert>Paired sample t-test:</alert> Compares means from the same group at different times (e.g., before and after a treatment) or from matched pairs.
    </p>

    1% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.

        <p>
          <term>One sample t -test:</term> 
          In the population, the average IQ is 100. A team of researcher want to test a new medication 
          to see if it has either a positive or negative effect on intelligence or no effect at all. 
          A sample of 30 participants who have taken the medication has a mean of 140 with a standard deviation of 20. 
          Did the medication effect intelligence? [CI=95%]
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Given: <m>\mu = 100, \, n = 30, \, \bar{x} = 140, \, s= 20, \, \alpha = 1-CI =1-0.95 =0.05.</m>

          Decision boundary: Use t table to find <m>t_{tab} </m>. If t-test or <m>t_{cal}</m> 
          is less than -2.045 or greater than +2.045, reject null hupothesis.

          Calculate t-test statistics,

            t_{cal} = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{140-100}{20/\sqrt{30}} =\frac{40}{3.45} =10.96.

        </p>
        <p>
          Conclusion: Decision rule: If <m>t_{cal}</m> or t-test is less than -2.045 or greater than +2.045, reject null hupothesis.
          Here, 
          <me>
             t_{cal} \gt t_{tab}
          </me>
          We must reject null hypothesis. i.e., medication has positive effect on intelligence.
        </p>
      </solution>
     </example>

     <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A random sample of size 20 from a normal population gives a sample mean of 42 and 
          sample standard deviation of 6. Test the hypothesis that the population mean is 44.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Given: <m>n=20, \, s=6, \, \bar{x}=42, \, \mu_o =44</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Step I: Null hypothesis, <m>H_o: \mu=\mu_o=44.</m> (population mean is same as sample mean.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Step II: Alternative hypothesis, <m>H_a: \mu \neq 44.</m>  (two tail test) (no wording for comparision)
        </p>
        <p>
         Step III:  Test Statistics: 
          <me>
            t_{cal} = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n-1}} = \frac{42-44}{6/\sqrt{19}} =-\frac{2}{1.38} =-1.45.
          </me>
          <m>d_f = n-1 =20-1 =19.</m>
          </p>
        <p>
          Step IV: Level of significance, <m>\alpha =0.05,\, d_f = 19.</m>
          <me>
            |t_{tab}| = 2.093.
          </me>
          use t table to determine the value of <m>t_{tab}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Step V: Comparision and Decision:
           <me>
            |t_{tab}| \gt |t_{cal}|
          </me>
          Hence, it is not significant, therefore, we fail to reject null hypothesis.
