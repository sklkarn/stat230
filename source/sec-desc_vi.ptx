  <title>Crosstabulation</title>

<p>
  Crosstabulation (cross-tab) is a table summary for two categorical vaiables 
  It is used to understand patterns between the variables. 
  It is also useful in hypothesis testing such as chi-square test and annova test. 
  To know the relationship between two nominal variables like class and unemployment, gender and drug use we use hypothesis testing.
  Categorical data are separated into different categories that are mutually exclusive (independent) from one another. 
  For example: eye color (blue, brown, green). It is impossible for eye color to belong to more than one color.

 Cross-tab is used for nominal/ordinal variables. It is a tool to descriptively examine variables and identify the relationship between two variables.
 The size of the crosstab is the number of categories of one variable multiplied by the number of categories of the second variable. 
 Cross tab presents joint frequencies, hence it is alos clalled a '<em>joint contingency table</em>'. 
 Each <term>cell</term> is an intersection of the two categories at that point. Table below shows a sample layout of a <m>2 \times 2</m> crosstab. 
 Analyzing large datasets can be difficult. Finding relevant, actionable insights within large amounts of data 
 is even more complicated. Crosstabs simplify and divide data into subgroups for ease of interpretationâ€”they show 
 percentages and frequencies that may change when contrasted with variables in other categories. 
 By making datasets more manageable at scale, fewer errors will result.

  Cross tabulation is typically used when you have information that can be divided into mutually exclusive groups, 
  also known as categorical variables. It allows you to examine relationships within the data that may not be readily apparent. 
  A crosstab report can show the connection between two or more survey questions from the study in market research studies.
  A Chi-square test is used to test data in a cross-tabulation table to determine whether or not the data is statistically significant. 
  The results are statistically significant if the two categorical variables are independent (unrelated). 
  Basically, the Chi-square test is a correlation test for categorical variables.

    cross tab may have additional information such as row and column <term>marginals</term> (i.e., total).
    <me>
      \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline 
      \text{ Political Parties} &amp; Women &amp; Men &amp; Total\\ \hline 
      Republican &amp; 27 &amp; 10 &amp; 37  \\ 
      Democratic &amp; 16 &amp; 15  &amp; 31 \\ \hline 
      Total &amp; 43 &amp; 25  &amp; 68 \\ \hline 
     \end{array}
    </me>
    The cell of the last row and the last column is called grand total. Here 68 is the grand total. Table can also reflect percentages. 
    <me>
      \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline 
      \text{ Political Parties} &amp; Women &amp; Men &amp; Total\\ \hline 
      Republican &amp; 27 (39.7\%) &amp; 10 (14.7\%) &amp; 37  \\ 
      Democratic &amp; 16 (23.5\%) &amp; 15  (22.1\%) &amp; 31 \\ \hline 
      Total &amp; 43 &amp; 25  &amp; 68 \\ \hline 
     \end{array}
    </me>
    To find the percentage divide each cell value by the grand total and multiply them by 100. 
    For example: 
    <me>
      \frac{10}{68} \times 100 = 14.7\%.
    </me>
