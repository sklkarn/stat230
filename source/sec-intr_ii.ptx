  <title>Variables</title>
 
<introduction>
  
  <p>
    A variable is a property that can take on many values. In other words, it is 
    characteristics of population which differs from individual to individual. For examples: "length", 
    "mass", "age", "gender", "place", "temperature", "proximity to a neighbour," etc. </p>
    <p>
      Variable is taken as singular. "age" is a variable but "ages" is not a variable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of variables: 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Quantitative (numerical) variables:
            <ol marker="i.">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Discrete variables: countable or finite number of values. For example: number of children in a household.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Continuous variables: measured or infinite number of values. For example: temperature, length of song, etc.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Qualitative (categorical) variables: Nominal, ordinal. For examples: "eye colors: brown, black", "state: Kentucky, Florida", 
            "dog breeds: Jerman shepheerd, Husky ", "gender: male, female", "survey" etc.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      <term> Explanatory (Independent) and Response (Ddependent) variables: </term> 
      In statistics, explanatory variables and response variables are used to describe relationships between variables 
      in a dataset. It measures the cause and effect of data. Imagine that researchers 
      want to test the effectiveness of a new weight loss medication. They split participants into three groups: 
      one group gets <m>0</m> mg dosage (control), another gets a <m>50</m> mg dosage, and the last group gets a <m>100</m> mg dosage. 
      After six months, the participants weights are measured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The independent variable is the cause. It explains, predicts, or influences changes in another variable. 
      Its value is independent of other variables in the study. For example: doses. It can be manipulated. 
             </p>
       <p>
        The dependent variable is the effect. It responds to or depends on changes in the explanatory variable. 
        Its value depends on changes in the independent variable. For example: weight. It can be measured.
       </p>
    
       <p> In a study investigating the relationship between hours of study and test scores: Hours of study is an Explanatory Variable and 
     Test scores is a Response Variable.

      <title>Data and Variables</title>
      <p>
        An individual (member of sample) is an object or person for whom you obtained data. 
        Data refers to the collection of facts, figures, measurements, or observations 
        that are gathered for analysis. Data can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (categorical) 
        and is used to answer questions, test hypotheses, and make decisions. For example: 
        Imagine conducting a survey to understand people's preferences for different types of coffee. 
        The responses you collected such as "likes espresso," "dislikes latte," "age 25," or "income $50,000" are your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The variables are the characteristics of the individuals, and the data are the specific values of the variables. 
        In the coffee preference survey: Age is a variable because it can vary from person to person. 
        Type of coffee preferred is a variable because different people may prefer different types of coffee. 
        Variables are also both qualitative and quantitative types.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you collect data, you are essentially gathering values for one or more variables. 
        For example, if you collect data on people's ages and coffee preferences, "age" and "type of coffee preferred" 
        are the variables, and the individual values for each person are the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <term>dataset</term> is a structured collection of data, typically organized in a table 
        where each row represents an observation (e.g., a person, a test result) and each column 
        represents a variable (e.g., age, income, coffee preference).
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a study examining the effects of exercise on health. 
        The researchers might collect data from 100 participants. Here's how data and variables relate in this context:
        <term> Variables:</term> Exercise Frequency (quantitative, discrete): How many times per week a participant exercises.
        Heart Rate (quantitative, continuous): A participant's resting heart rate. 
        Gender (qualitative, nominal): Male or Female.
        Health Rating (qualitative, ordinal): A self-reported scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
       <term> Data:</term> For each participant, you collect values for these variables. 
       For example, Participant 1 might have the data: exercises 3 times a week, 
       has a heart rate of 70 bpm, is male, and rates their health as a 4.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In a table I column is observations, I row is variables and the intersection of each row and column is a data.
        Data: The actual values you collect (e.g., "3 times a week," "70 bpm," "male," "rating 4").
        Variables: The characteristics that those values describe (e.g., Exercise Frequency, Heart Rate, Gender, Health Rating).
