  <title>Variables</title>
 

   
  <p>A variable is a property that can take on many values. In other words, it is 
    characteristics of population which differs from individual to individual. For examples: "length", 
    "mass", "age", "gender", "place", "temperature", "proximity to a neighbour," etc. </p>
    <p>
      Variable is taken as singular. "age" is a variable but "ages" is not a variable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two types of variables: 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Quantitative (numerical) variables:
            <ol marker="i">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Discrete variables: countable or finite number of values. For example: number of children in a household.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Continuous variables: measured or infinite number of values. For example: temperature, length of song, etc.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Qualitative (categorical) variables: Nominal, ordinal. For examples: "eye colors: brown, black", "state: Kentucky, Florida", 
            "dog breeds: Jerman shepheerd, Husky ", "gender: male, female", "survey" etc.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Independent and dependent variables: </term> To test cause-and-effect relationships 
      there are two kinds of variables based on whether to manipulate or measure. Imagine that researchers 
      want to test the effectiveness of a new weight loss medication. They split participants into three groups: 
      one group gets 0 mg dosage (control), another gets a 50 mg dosage, and the last group gets a 100 mg dosage. After six months, the participants weights are measured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The independent variable is the cause. Its value is independent of other variables in your study. It can be manipulated. For example: doses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dependent variable is the effect. Its value depends on changes in the independent variable. It can be measured. For example: weight.
       </p>
