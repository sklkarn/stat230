  <title>Population and Sampling</title>

 <introduction>
  
  <p><term>Population: </term> Any collection of individual items or units which are the subject of investigation. </p>
  
    <p>
      <term>Sampling Method:</term> The goal of sampling is to create a sample that is representative of the population it is being drawn from. 
      The size of population is represented using the letter <m>N</m> and the size of sample is represented using the letter <m>n.</m> 
      The most basic sampling methods are:

            <term>Simple Random Sampling: </term> Every member of the population, <m>N</m> has an equal chance of 
            being selected for the sample, <m>n</m>.

            <term>Stratified Sampling: </term> The population, <m>N</m> is split into non-overlapping groups (strate), 
            then simple random sampling is done on each group to form a sample, <m>n.</m> For example: 
            split population of student in 'women' and 'men' group.

        <title>Bias in Sampling</title>
        <p>
          Bias refers to a systematic error that creates misleading conclusion about the population. 
          It can occur at different stages of data collection, analysis, and interpretation.  
          Here are some common types of bias in statistics:

                <term>Sampling Bias: </term> It occurs when the sample is not representative of the population.
                It can happen due to faulty sampling methods, when selecting participants for the sample 
                causes certain groups to be underrepresented or overrepresented. Convenience sample gets sampling bias 
                as the individuals are not selected from random sample.
                Example: Conducting a survey on internet for only those individuals who are already online,
                 thereby excluding those who may not have access to the internet.

            <li>
              <p>
               <term> Nonresponse Bias:</term> It happens when a significant portion of the selected sample does not 
               respond, and those who do respond differ in relevant ways from those who do not. 
               If individuals with strong opinions on a topic are more likely to respond to a survey, 
               while those who are indifferent do not, the results may be skewed toward more extreme views.

                <term>Response Bias: </term> It exists when the answers on survey do not reflect the true 
                feelings of the respondent. It can occur in a number of ways. In a survey on alcohol consumption, 
                respondents might underreport their drinking habits because excessive drinking is socially frowned upon. 
                This bias is especially prevalent in sensitive topics like drug use, income, or sexual behavior. 
                When presented with a <em>Likert scale</em> (e.g., 1-5, where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree), 
                some participants may consistently choose the "agree" option (4 or 5) without fully considering 
                each question. This can lead to artificially high agreement levels.
