  <title>Population and Sampling</title>

 <introduction>
  
  <p><term>Population: </term> Any collection of individual items or units which are the 
    subject of investigation is a population. An individual item is a member of population being investigated. 
    A sample is a small group of items that are selected from the population. 
    In other words <term>sample</term> is a subset of population. 
   </p>
  <p>
    For example: All students of the school is a population (total of 200 student). Each student is a member of the population, and if we select 
    50 random students from the school to participate in some kind of study then they are sample.
  </p>
  <p>
    In statistics, "statistic" and "parameter" are terms used to distinguish between measures 
    calculated from a sample and those related to the entire population. 
    <term>Statistic:</term> It is a numerical summary of the sample. For example: mean, median, mode, etc. 
    Suppose you survey 100 students at a school to estimate the average height of all students. 
    The average height calculated from your sample (e.g., 5'8") is a statistic. 
    <term>Parameter:</term> It is a numerical summary of the population. 
    Unlike a statistic, which is calculated from a sample, a parameter represents the true value for the population. 
    If you could measure the height of every student at the school, the actual average height of all students (e.g., 5'9") would be a parameter. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Parameters are often unknown because it is impossible to measure the entire population. 
    The goal of statistical analysis is to estimate population parameters using sample statistics. 
    Since we usually cannot measure an entire population, we rely on sample statistic to estimate population parameters.
  </p>
    
 <p>
  Suppose you are interested in understanding the average height of male students in your school. 
  If you could somehow measure the height of every male student in the school, you would calculate 
  the true average height of all these male students. Let's say this true average height is 5'10" (or, 70 inches). 
  This 70 inches is a parameter because it reflects the average height of the entire population of male students in your school. 
  Since measuring every male student in the school is impractical, you decide to randomly select a sample of 
  100 male students and measure their heights. You calculated the average height of these 100 students and 
  found that it is 5'9" (69 inches). This 69 inches is a statistic because it reflects the average height of your sample.

        <title>Sampling Method:</title>
        <p>
          The goal of sampling is to create a sample that is representative of the population it is being drawn from. 
          The size of population is represented using the letter <m>N</m> and the size of sample is represented using the letter <m>n.</m> 
          The most basic sampling methods are:

                then simple random sampling is done on each group to form a sample, <m>n.</m> For example: 
                split population of student in 'women' and 'men' group.

        <title>Bias in Sampling</title>
        <p>
          Bias refers to a systematic error that creates misleading conclusion about the population. 
          It can occur at different stages of data collection, analysis, and interpretation.  
          Here are some common types of bias in statistics:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol marker="i">
            <li>
              <p>
                <term>Sampling Bias: </term> It occurs when the sample is not representative of the population.
                It can happen due to faulty sampling methods, when selecting participants for the sample 
                causes certain groups to be underrepresented or overrepresented. Convenience sample gets sampling bias 
                as the individuals are not selected from random sample.
                Example: Conducting a survey on internet for only those individuals who are already online,
                 thereby excluding those who may not have access to the internet.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
               <term> Nonresponse Bias:</term> It happens when a significant portion of the selected sample does not 
               respond, and those who do respond differ in relevant ways from those who do not. 
               If individuals with strong opinions on a topic are more likely to respond to a survey, 
               while those who are indifferent do not, the results may be skewed toward more extreme views.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <term>Response Bias: </term> It exists when the answers on survey do not reflect the true 
                feelings of the respondent. It can occur in a number of ways. In a survey on alcohol consumption, 
                respondents might underreport their drinking habits because excessive drinking is socially frowned upon. 
                This bias is especially prevalent in sensitive topics like drug use, income, or sexual behavior. 
                When presented with a <em>Likert scale</em> (e.g., 1-5, where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree), 
                some participants may consistently choose the "agree" option (4 or 5) without fully considering 
                each question. This can lead to artificially high agreement levels.
