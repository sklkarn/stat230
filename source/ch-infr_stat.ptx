  <title>Inferential Statistics</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Inferential statistics helps to make inferences about a population based on a sample data. 
      It shows the elationship with descriptive statistics. It uses probability theory to estimate 
      population parameters, test hypotheses, and make predictions.  
      Here are the main components and techniques of inferential statistics: 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Population vs. Sample:</term>
          Population: The entire group of individuals or instances about whom we hope to learn.
          Sample: A subset of the population selected for analysis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Parameter vs. Statistic:</term>
          Parameter: A numerical characteristic of a population (e.g., population mean).
          Statistic: A numerical characteristic of a sample (e.g., sample mean) used to estimate the population parameter.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Estimation:</term>
          Point Estimation: Provides a single value estimate of a population parameter (e.g., the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean).
          Interval Estimation: Provides a range of values (confidence interval) within which the population parameter is expected to lie.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Hypothesis Testing:</term>
          Formulating a null hypothesis (H₀) and an alternative hypothesis (H₁).
          Using test statistics to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.
          Common tests include t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Confidence Intervals (z/t distribution):</term>
          A range of values derived from sample statistics that is likely to contain the population parameter. 
          Typically expressed at a confidence level, such as 95%.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Significance Levels <m>(\alpha)</m>:</term>
          The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error).
          Common significance levels are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>P-value:</term>
          The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, 
          under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.
          A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Types of Errors:</term>
            Type I Error: Incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
            Type II Error: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Power of a Test:</term>
          The probability that the test correctly rejects a false null hypothesis (1 - Type II error rate).  
          One-tailed and two-tailed test. Types of tests in statistics (z-test, t-test, chi-square test, annova (F) test, etc.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>Regression Analysis:</term>
            Assessing the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
            Includes techniques like linear regression, multiple regression, and logistic regression.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <term>ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):</term>
            Comparing means across multiple groups to see if at least one group mean is different from the others.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
           <term> Non-parametric Tests:</term>
          Used when data do not meet the assumptions required for parametric tests.
          Includes tests like the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      Inferential statistics helps in making generalizations from a sample to a population, testing theories, 
      and making predictions, which are crucial for scientific research, policy-making, and various fields 
      requiring data analysis.
