  <title>Central Limit Theorem (CLT) </title>
    
      <p>
        It states that the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger. 
        It holds true if the sample size, <m>n \geq</m> 30 (population may be normally or skewed distributed). 
        When <m>n \lt 30</m> then it only works for the normally distributed population.
      </p>
      <p>
        The essential component of the CLT is that average sample means will be the population mean. 
        Relation between the shape of population distribution and the shape of sampling distribution of mean is known as CLT. 
        It helps inference about the population parameters without knowing the shape of frquency of population distribution. 
        As the sample size gets larger, sampling distribution becomes almost normal regardless of the shape of population.

 According to CLT normal distribution is the limiting distribution to the sum of independent random variables with finite variance 
 as the number of random variables get indefinitely large. 
</p>
<p> 
  Since many real processes yield distributions with finite variance, this 
 theorem has a wide range of application in sampling theory and other areas of statistics.
  If <m>x_i (i=1, 2, 3, \cdots, n) </m> be independently distributed random variables such that <m>E(x_i) = \mu_i</m> 
  and <m>\var(x_i)=\sigma_i^2</m> then as <m>n\to \infty</m>, the distribution of the sum of these random variables, namely 
  <me>
    S_n = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + \cdots + x_n
  </me>
  tends to the normal distribution with mean, <m>\mu</m> and variance <m>\sigma^2,</m>  where <m>\mu = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i,</m> 
 <m>\sigma^2 =  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^2.</m>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are 250 cats at show, when average weight of cat is 12 kg, with standard deviation of 8 kg. If we choose 4 samples, 
          then what is the probability they have an average weight greater than 10 kg and less than 25 kg?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Given: Population size, <m>N=250 \,cats, \mu =12 kg, \sigma=8 kg, </m> Sample size, <m>n=4. </m>
          then <me>
            P(10\lt \bar{x}\lt 25)=?
          </me>
          <me>
            z_{score} = \frac{x-\mu_{\bar{x}}}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}
          </me>
          and 
          <me>
            \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
          </me>
          where, <m>\mu </m> = population mean, <m>\sigma</m> = population standard deviation, 
          <m>\mu_{\bar{x}}</m> = sample mean, <m>\sigma_{\bar{x}}</m> = sample standard deviation, and <m>n=</m> sample size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, 
          <me>
            \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{4}} =4.
          </me>
          Hence, z-score = 
          <me>
            z_{25} =\frac{25-12}{4} = 13/4=3.25.
          </me>
          and 
          <me>
            z_{10} =\frac{10-12}{4} = -2/4=-0.5.
          </me>
        </p>

          <image source="z1.png" width="50%"/>
      </figure>
        <p>
          Using z-table, we have 
          <me>
            z_{value(3.25)} = 0.9940
          </me>
          Hence, area under the curve to the left = 0.994. Also, 
          <me>
            z_{value(-0.5)} = 0.3085
          </me>
          Hence, area under the curve to the left = 0.3085.
          Subtracting these two values, we get 
          <me>
            P(10\lt \bar{x}\lt 25) = 0.9940 -0.3085 = 0.6855 = 68.55\%.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A coin is tossed 200 times, find the approximate probability that the number of heads obtained is between 80 and 120.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>x:</m> number of heads, 
          <me>
            p(h) = \frac{1}{2}
          </me>
          Discrete binomial distribution.
          Since the sample size, <m>n=200</m> is very large, we can apply CLT. From binomial distribution approximation, we have - 
          mean, <m>\mu =np=200 \times  \frac{1}{2} = 100</m> and variance, <m>\sigma^2 = npq = 200\times  \frac{1}{2} \times  \frac{1}{2} = 50.</m>
          here <m>q=1-p</m>. Now  <m>P(80\lt x \lt 120)=?</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now,  <me>
            z_{score} = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x-100}{\sqrt{50}}
          </me>
          Hence, 
          <me>
            z_{80} = \frac{80-100}{\sqrt{50}} = -2.82
          </me>
          and  <me>
            z_{120} = \frac{120-100}{\sqrt{50}} = 2.82
          </me>
          Therefore, the required probability = 
          <me>
            P(80\lt x \lt 120) = P(-2.82 \lt z \lt 2.82)
          </me>
        </p>

      <p>
          Use standard normal distribution table, we get -
           <me>
            P(z_{-2.82})= 0.0024
          </me>
        Therefore, 
          <me>
            P(z_{2.82})= 0.9976
          </me>
          Hence, 
          <me>
            P(-2.82 \lt z \lt 2.82) = 0.9952
          </me>
          
        </p>
