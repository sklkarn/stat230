  <title>Graphical Representation</title>

<introduction>
  <p> Graphical representation involves visual tools to summarize and present data 
    in a way that highlights patterns, trends, and insights. There are different types of graphical 
    representation. Some of them are as follows:</p>
<p>
  <ol marker="i">
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Line Graphs</term> Line graph or the linear graph is used to display the continuous data 
        and it is useful for predicting future events over time. Example: Stock prices over a year.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Bar Graphs</term> Bar Graph is used to display the category of data and it compares the data using 
        solid bars to represent the quantities. It compares the number, frequency, or other measure (e.g., mean) 
        for different discrete categories. Example: Showing the sales of different product categories.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Histograms</term> The graph that uses bars to represent the frequency of numerical data that are organised into intervals. 
        Since all the intervals are equal and continuous, all the bars have the same width (called bins). Example: Distribution of students' test scores.
      </p>

    </figure>
    </li>
      <li>
      <p>
        <term>Stem and Leaf Plot</term> In the stem and leaf plot, the data are organised from least value to the greatest value. 
        The digits of the least place values from the leaves and the next place value digit forms the stems. 
        Example: Showing test scores in a detailed manner.
        <me>
          \begin{array}{c|c} 
          \text{ Stem} &amp; Leaf \\ \hline 
          0 &amp; 1 \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad3 \quad3 \quad 4 \quad 4 \\ 
          1 &amp; 5 \quad6 \quad6 \quad8 \\ 
          2 &amp; 0 \quad3 \\ 
          3 &amp; 7 \quad8   \\ 
          4 &amp;     \\ 
          5 &amp; 5\quad 7 \quad8 \quad8   \\ 
          6 &amp; 0 \quad0 \quad0 \quad1 \quad2 \quad4\quad4\quad 4   \\ 
          7 &amp; 5 \quad5 \quad6 \quad7 \quad7 \quad7\quad8 \quad8 \quad9    \\ \hline 
         \end{array}
      </me>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Dot plot</term> A dot plot groups the number of data points in a data set based on the value of each point.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Box and Whisker Plot</term> It displays the distribution of a dataset based on a five-number summary 
        (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum). It shows the range (spread) and the middle ( median) of the data. 
        Example: Comparing the distribution of test scores across different classes.

      <figure>
        <caption>Box Plot</caption>
        <image source="boxplt.png" width="50%"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In a box plot, the upper whisker represents the upper boundary of the data that is not considered an outlier. 
      It is calculated based on the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first quartile (Q1) 
      and the third quartile (Q3). Here's how to calculate the upper whisker:
      <me>
        IQR = Q_3-Q_1
      </me>
       <me>
       \text{ upper whisker} \leq Q_3+1.5\times IQR.
      </me>
      Upper Whisker (UW) equals to maximum data observation value that is less than or equal to Upper Bound.
      <me>
        \text{ lower whisker} \geq Q_1 -1.5\times IQR.
       </me>
       Lower Whisker (LW) equals to minimum data observation value that is greater than or equal to Lower Bound.
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ upper bound} \amp = Q_3 +1.5\times IQR </mrow>
        <mrow>\text{ lower bound} \amp = Q_1-1.5\times IQR </mrow>
      </md>
      Values greater than Upper Bound or less than Lower Bound are considered to be outliers.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Pie Chart (Circle Graph) </term> It shows the relationships of the parts of the whole. 
        The circle is considered with 100% and the categories occupied is represented with that specific percentage like 15%, 56%, etc. 
        Example: Market share of different companies.

    </figure>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       <term> Scatter Plot</term> To show the relationship between two continuous variables. 
    Example: Relationship between height and weight.
      </p>
      <figure>

      <p>
        <term>Frequency Table</term> The table shows the number of pieces of data that falls within the given interval. 
        <me>
          \begin{array}{c|c|c} 
         Color &amp; Tally   &amp; Frequency \\ \hline

      <title>Outliers</title>
      <p>
        Outliers are extreme data points with respect to normal data points. 
        They are unusual values in your dataset which can distort statistical analyses and violate their assumptions. 
        Unfortunately, all analysts will confront outliers and be forced to make decisions about what to do with them. 
        Given the problems they can cause, you might think that it's best to remove them from your data. 
        But, that's not always the case. Removing outliers is legitimate only for specific reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Removing outliers: Outliers can be very informative about the subject-area and data collection process. 
        It's essential to understand how outliers occur and whether they might happen again as a normal part of the 
        process or study area. Unfortunately, resisting the temptation to remove outliers inappropriately can be difficult. 
        Outliers increase the variability in your data, which decreases statistical power. 
        Consequently, excluding outliers can cause your results to become statistically significant. 
        There are two methods to remove outliers: standard deviation (z-score) method and IQR method. 
        We can use the IQR method of identifying outliers to set up a “fence” outside of <m>Q_1</m> and <m>Q_3</m>. 
        Any values that fall outside of this fence are considered outliers. To build this fence we take 1.5 times 
        the IQR and then subtract this value from <m>Q_1</m>  and add this value to <m>Q_3</m> . 
        This gives us the minimum and maximum fence posts that we compare each observation to. 
        Any observations that are more than 1.5 (IQR) below <m>Q_1</m>  or more than 1.5 (IQR) above <m>Q_3</m>  
        are considered outliers.  
      </p>
      <figure>
        <caption>z-score</caption>
        <image source="zscore.png" width="50%"/>
    </figure>
<p>
  When a distribution is normal, the histogram takes on a bell shape, which is why it is sometimes referred to as a “bell curve.” 
  A standard normal distribution, also called the z-distribution, is the most commonly used normal distribution with a mean of 0 
  and a standard deviation of 1. In the standard normal distribution, <m>68\%</m> of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 
  <m>95\%</m> falls within 2 standard deviations, and <m>99.7\%</m> falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. 
  Consider the image of the bell curve. In all normal distributions, the area under the curve is 1, the curve is symmetrical 
  around the mean, and exactly half of the data falls on the right and left of the mean. Any value falls out side of 
  3 standard deviation, that is less than <m>-3\sigma</m> and higher than <m>+3\sigma</m> are considered as outliers.

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The student test scores are: 74, 88, 78, 90, 94, 90, 84, 90, 98, and 80. Find the outliers.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Arrange the data in ascending order: 74, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 90, 90, 94, 98. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Five number summary: 74, 80, 89, 90, 98.
            <me>
              IQR = Q_3-Q_1 = 90-80=10.
            </me>
            <md>
              <mrow>\text{ upper fence} \amp = Q_3 +1.5\times IQR = 90+1.5*10 = 105.</mrow>
              <mrow>\text{ lower fence} \amp = Q_1-1.5\times IQR = 80 -1.5*10 = 65.</mrow>
            </md>
            Any scores that are less than 65 or greater than 105 are outliers. Hence, here we do not have any outliers.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A survey was given to a random sample of 20 sophomore college students. 
            They were asked, “how many textbooks do you own?” Their responses, 
            were: 0, 0, 2, 5, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 14, 15, 20, and 25.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Arrange the data in ascending order: 0, 0, 2, 5, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 14, 15, 20, 25. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Five number summary: 0, 8, 10, 12, 25.
              <me>
                IQR = Q_3-Q_1 = 12-8 =4.
              </me>
                <md>
                <mrow>\text{ upper fence} \amp = Q_3 +1.5\times IQR = 12+1.5*4 = 18.</mrow>
                <mrow>\text{ lower fence} \amp = Q_1-1.5\times IQR = 8 -1.5*4 = 2.</mrow>
              </md>
              Any scores that are less than 2 or greater than 18 are outliers. Hence, we have 0, 0, 20, and 25 are outliers.
          </p>
