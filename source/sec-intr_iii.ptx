  <title>Levels of Measurement</title>
  <p>
    They are also called scales of measurement. It tells how precisely variables are recorded. 
    In scientific research, a variable is anything that can take on different values across the data set (e.g., height or test scores).
  </p>
  <p>
   There are 4 levels of measurement: 
   <ol marker ="i.">
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Nominal:</term> the data can only be categorized. For example: color, gender, preferences, etc.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Ordinal:</term> the data can be categorized and ranked. Here order of the 
        data matters but distances between values does not. For example: I, II, and III place in race. 
        Suppose, I took 10 seconds to finish the race, II took 15 seconds, and III took 25 second to finish the race.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Interval: </term> the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced. 
        Here order matters and distance between values are equal and meaningful, and a natural zero is not 
        present (or zero is arbitrary, it has no meaning). Negative values are allowed. For example: Temperature in Celcius or Fahrenheit scale. 
        As <m>0 ^{o} C </m> does not mean no temperature or no heat; IQ score, Time of the day, SAT scores, pH scale, calender years, etc.  
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <term>Ratio:</term> the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero. Negative values are not allowed.
        Here order matters and distance between values are equal and meaningful, and a natural zero is present. 
        For example: Temperature in Kelvin scale. As <m>0 K </m> means no temperature or no heat; height, Weight, age, speed of a vehicles, 
        income levels, distance travelled, time duration, etc.
      </p>
    </li>
   </ol>
    There is a hierarchy in the complexity and precision of the level of measurement, from low (nominal) to high (ratio). 
    Nominal data has <em>less information</em> than ratio data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different types of data allow for the different types of data analysis.
