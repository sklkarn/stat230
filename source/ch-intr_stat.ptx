  <introduction>
    <p> The following topics are being discussed here. </p>

            What is statistics?
          </p>
          <p>
            <term>Statistics:</term> It is science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and 
            interpreting data and drawing conclusion from the given data (informations).
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the 2014 Surgeon General's Report, about 3 out of 4 high school students 
            who smoke never quit smoking.

          <p>
            Almost <m>85\%</m> of lung cancer in men and <m>45\%</m> in women are tobacco related.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a <m>40\%</m> chance that in a room full of 30 people, two of them have the same date of birth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The average ACT score of the students is 19.5.

            Statisctics is divided into two parts:

                <p>
                  <term>Descriptive statistics: </term> the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data is done here. 
                  It helps us to understand the main feature of the data. Central tendency, spread, and 
                  deviation, etc. of the data can be studied here. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  It organizes and summarizes the information of data. It consists of graph, table, 
                  descriptive measures suchas average, variations, percentiles, etc.

                  Testing whether the average exam scores of two groups are significantly different.

            Population and sampling:

            Population is the entire group of individuals. eg., all people of USA, all users of Netflix, etc.

          <p>
            Sample is a subset of population. To reduce the cost of data collection or the taking full census data is 
            not possible we take <term>sample.</term>
