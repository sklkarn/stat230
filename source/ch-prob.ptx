  <title>Probability</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event to occur. 
      Many events cannot be predicted with total certainty. 
      Probability can help predict the chance of an event to occur. 
      It measures the extent to which something is likely to happen. 
      Many events cannot be predicted with total certainty. We can predict only the chance of an event to occur 
      i.e., how likely they are going to happen, using it. Probability can range from 0 to 1, 
      where 0 means the event to be an impossible one and 1 indicates a certain event.
